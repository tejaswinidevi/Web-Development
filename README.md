# Web-Development

This is a repo to track my progress on Web Development.
Tutorial folder contains all the stuff that i have done while following the tutorial which can be ignored. Please refer HTML Project folder to see my first HTML Project. I have done this HTML Project on my own as is given at the end of the [freeCodeCamp's HTML tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE).
